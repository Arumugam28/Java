Notes:
- These programs demonstrate array and matrix manipulation using loops and conditionals.
- Each program has sample input values inside the main() method.
- You can modify array or matrix values for testing.
- Focuses on array traversal, comparisons, rotations, matrix addition, transpose, and multiplication.
