Basics Java Assignment – String Manipulation Tasks
Prepared for: Arumugam B

Files included (8 Java source files):

1. ReverseStringManual.java – Reverses a given string without using built-in functions.
2. LongestUniqueSubstring.java – Finds the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
3. WordCount.java – Counts the number of words in a given string.
4. MostFrequentChar.java – Finds the most frequent character in a string.
5. AnagramCheck.java – Checks whether two strings are anagrams of each other.
6. RemoveWhiteSpaces.java – Removes all white spaces from a given string.
7. CapitalizeWords.java – Capitalizes the first letter of each word in a string.
8. FirstNonRepeatedChar.java – Finds the first non-repeated character in a string.

How to compile all files:
javac *.java

How to run an example:
java ReverseStringManual
java LongestUniqueSubstring
java CapitalizeWords

Notes:
- These programs demonstrate string traversal, frequency counting, comparison, and manipulation techniques.
- Each program can be tested by modifying the input string directly inside the main() method.
- Suitable for practicing loops, condition checks, and Java string handling without relying on advanced libraries.
